# Programming-foundation-Real-World-Examples
### Course details

-  Understanding core programming concepts and why they are used is just as important as knowing how to write code. New programmers need to learn to bridge the gap: to connect the theory to practice. This series of training videos explains basic programming concepts by relating them to real-life objects, actions, and scenarios. Each video will focus on a different analogy, mixing live action with segments that demonstrate the concepts in code. For example, Barron Stone connects functions to recipes, lists to parking spaces, and loops to that perpetual chore: dishwashing. He illustrates most of the examples using Python, but you can follow along in any language you choose. Start watching and learn about...
